            Since 2007, Possibility Films has been producing films as an independent film production company that is
            very much in touch with telling engaging stories with people, pictures, words, and sounds. When asked, "what
            genre of films does Possibility Films make"? we resist defining our movies with a predictable style, unless
            you think that making stories about people in challenging and conflicting circumstances is a style. We've
            done musical (Leroy Silk Unmuted), science-fiction/action (Defective), horror (Dead Genesis), thriller (Love
            Never Dies), drama (Mona and Theo), and even a touch of comedy (Too Low). Our films are entertaining,
            compelling, often edgy, occassionally unsettling, and always told with humanity at the core of the stories.
